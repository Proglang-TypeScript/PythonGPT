# Setup

⚠️ **Warning**: PythonGPT executes code generated by large language models, that means **it should only be executed in secure environments**!

To set up this library, run the usual pip command:
```bash
python3 -m pip install <path to this project>
```

If you do not want to clone this project you can also run:
```bash
python3 -m pip install "pythongpt @ git+https://github.com/Mieschendahl/PythonGPT.git"
```

After that, set your [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) to the environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
```

Now you can import `pythongpt` and use it in your code.

If you want to execute the demo code run:
```bash
python3 -m pythongpt
```
